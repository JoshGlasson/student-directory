# STUDENT DIRECTORY #

The student directory script allows you to manage a list of students.

## How to use ##

Run the program and follow the interactive menu to interact with it.

*Additional Features*

Additional features have been added to the app from the basic version. Along with creating a displaying a list of students and their cohort, you can now remove names from the list, clear the list completely and manage the csv files they are saved into. This means you can delete csv files that you have created previously, and when saving, you will be warned if there is another file with the same name, and give you the option to either overwrite the old file or append the new information into the existing file.
You can also enter a month to see all the students in that cohort.

I have also added testing into the file, to ensure everything is working as it should.
